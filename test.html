                                         From the "dot.com" implosion, to the infamy of 9/11, to the expensive and immoral wars and wanton waste of our young people and resources, to the economic meltdown of 2008, to today's struggling economy and divisive election, we have lived through a most challenging and discouraging early 21st Century. Our polictical parties seem to have lost sight of what is important in America, they have lost touch with the people and the will of the people. Our government seems to have joined hands with the Princes of Wall Street to plunder and pillage our economic welfare.It is increasingly obvious that we, the people of the United States must become active and assume the mantle of leadership in restoring the strength, honor, integrity and economy of America. We must stand strong in our resolve for freedom, for a fair and just society, for economic growth, oppotrunity and stability, We must unite to recognize the equality of all humankind. <br><br>
